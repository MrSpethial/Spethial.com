# Hello, World!

Welcome to **Spethial.com** — a personal corner of the internet where ideas come to life (eventually).

## What is this place?

This is a blog, a playground, and a testing ground all rolled into one. It's where I document my journey as a Product Manager who codes, share experiments, and occasionally ramble about things that interest me.

## Why "Spethial"?

Good question. It's a play on "special" with a twist — a name that's unique, memorable, and doesn't take itself too seriously. Just like this website.

## What to expect

- **Blog posts**: Thoughts on product management, coding, and the intersection of both
- **Experiments**: Random technical explorations in the [Playground](/playground)
- **Caffeine-fueled insights**: Because all the best ideas happen after the third cup of coffee

## The tech stack

This site is built with:

- React 18 + TypeScript
- Vite for blazing fast development
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- MDX for content
- Deployed on Vercel

It's intentionally simple. No complex backends, no databases (for now). Just clean, fast, and functional.
